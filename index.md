I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2027.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 9:
In lab 9 there were two parts. The first part dealt with building a mad lib which got user input for certain blanks in the sentence. It was very cool to build this model and to see if it runs properly with user input. The second part involved calculating the total for black jack. This was fun to do because it taught me about the game black jack and how to write a program that will automate this process. 

Lab 4:
 In this lab we were asked to convert a certain measurement into another measurement. For example ounces to cups. Even though this lab is pretty simple it taught me the most basic foundations of coding and how to make a program to automate easy tasks such as conversions. It was one of my most successful labs I remember and it solidified some of the basics of coding for me.

Lab 10"
 In lab 10 there were two parts, the first part involved creating a program that could decipher whether a number was prime or not. Through the use of the trivial division algorithm I was able to code this successfully. The second part was really cool because it taught us how to write and access different elements from different files. It also solidified my use of vectors.
